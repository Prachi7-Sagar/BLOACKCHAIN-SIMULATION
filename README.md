# BLOACKCHAIN-SIMULATION


Dependencies
hashlib
datetime
Dependencies can be installed using pip. But actually just run this in colab so you don't need to install anything.

Usage
You can download the juypter notebook and run it locally. Also, here is the colab link to run it in the browser (recommended).

Credits
The credits for the original code go to howcodeORG. I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
